# BS4 Helper

## jQuery Initialization

Without BS4 Helper you have to initialize elements like tooltips yourself with `jQuery`. But, BS4 Helper does all that initialization for you. Just import it by following this [link](https://bhogi7589.github.io/bs4-helper)!

### jQuery Additions

BS4 Helper also adds and initializes components like Growing Progress Bars. Just add `data-progress="grow"` and `data-max-width=100` to a `<div>` element with `class="progress-bar"`

## Additional Styling

BS4 Helper also adds additional styling properties to Bootstrap 4 classes like `.display-1,2,3,4`.

## New Classes

BS4 Helper also adds new classes to Bootstrap 4 like `.heading`, `.heading-large`, `.heading-medium`, `heading-small`, `.heading-red`, `heading-orange` etc.
